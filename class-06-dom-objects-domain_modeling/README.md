### Schedule
1. Announcements
1. Domain Modeling and Objects
1. The DOM
1. Lab Prep

### Announcements
* Weekly survey!

## Learning Objectives
* Translate a problem domain into understandable TODOs and user stories.
* Create a code model for a problem domain using JavaScript objects literals.
* Access and reassign object properties and methods using dot notation and bracket notation.
* Append list items to the DOM using JavaScript.

## Notes
* Domain Modeling and Objects
    * Build an instance of a model with an object literal
        * Properties
        * Methods
    * Accessing and reassigning properties
    * [dan's useful notes on objects](dan-objects.md)
* The DOM
    * Your HTML elements as JavaScript objects!! With properties and methods!
    * accessing existing HTML elements with JavaScript
    * creating and adding HTML elements with JavaScript
    * [dan's useful notes on adding to the DOM](dan-DOM.md)
* Today's Lab
    * Yes, I know it's a lot of info to get through, but as a developer, it's now part of your job to translate human to computer. You got this. As always, we encourage you to pair with someone - writing your TODOs and objectives as a pair or mob is a great place to start.
    * There is a lot of repetition, but **DON'T COPY/PASTE YOUR STORE OBJECTS!!!!** Type them out to gain practice conceptualizing objects and getting familiar with their syntax.
