# Week 2 Project: Salmon Cookies
# Class 9 - Lab Assignment

Continue working on the functionality of your **sales.html** page if you do not have it working 100% yet.

Here's your other tasks for today:



- Style up the public facing page (**index.html**) to make it appealing to customers.
- Here are the requirements as listed in the original support doc:
	1. A custom Google font for highlights
	2. A specified standard san-serif web font for data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica)
	3. A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times, etc.)
	4. Specified different font colors for all three font usages
	5. A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)
	6. A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)
	7. Anything else you'd like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity,  and consistency are good things in design.
	8. Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.
	9. Include all of the typical stuff that you'll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, contact information, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user.
- NOTE: You **must** use all of the images in the adjacent asset directory. Your client insists that you use Every. Single. One.
- Your public-facing **index.html** page should have all of the things you'd expect such a page to have for such a business: locations with addresses, hours open, contact information, and so on. Just do mockups of these things since this is not a real business, of course.
- You can also mock up references (either links or sections on the **index.html** page) for things like About Us (company history and mission), Merchandise (sales of t-shirts, mugs, stickers, etc.), links to salmon events like the Salmon Days in Issaquah, etc.

- Apply a similar style to the **sales.html** page.



### Stretch Goals (Not required!)

- Give your input form functionality to update the data for a location that is already in the table. This is going to require some additional pieces, such as:
	- Some kind of `if` statement to test whether the inputted cookie stand location name matches one that is already in the table (or other mechanism to indicate which location to update)
	- The new input numbers need to be run through the calculation methods as with the original creation of the instances

- Make a style guide, using [this one that a team Brian was on made for Everlast](http://everlast.com/style-guide) as a model.

- Make two additional pages:
	- Mock up an order form that would be public facing (**store.html**) so that visitors to the website can order salmon cookies and swag. That form would need to receive all of the things you'd expect on an order form: name, address, payment info, products to order, quantities, special instructions, and so on.
	- A second 'private' page (**order-processing.html**) that shows a list of pending orders and the individual order details. The business owner can then process the orders by clicking a button next to the order that then moves that list item to a 'Filled Orders' list at the bottom of the page.
