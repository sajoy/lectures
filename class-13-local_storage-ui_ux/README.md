    * Uses Object Oriented Programming to model appropriate entities
    * Global variables and functions are kept to a minimum
    * Responds to user events
    * Data persists between page reloads

## Learning Objectives
- Store, retrieve, and access data stored in using the browser's local storage.

## Notes
* Code Review
    * [Charlz Bus Mall Code Review](https://github.com/CharlyWelch/bus-mall/pull/3/files)
* UI and UX
    * UI and UX decisions will be driven by
        * how you want your user to feel when using your product
            * confused?
            * successful?
            * in control?
            * serious?
            * playful?
        * what your goal for the user is
            * log a crap ton of hours in your app?
            * gain understanding around a topic?
            * sign up for an email list?
            * visit a brick and mortar shop?
        * research
            * user interviews
                * watch people using your app, without telling them what to do. 
                * watch people using your app, given a specific task - what do they try? why?
    * user interface
        * how the user can interact with the web page
        * goal of ui:
            - easy to use
            - easy to understand
            - effective for the end-goal (or product)
        * [goodui.org](http://www.goodui.org/)
        * remember those ol' alerts? [sweet alert](http://www.javascripting.com/view/sweetalert)
        * [5 examples we can learn from](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/bad-design-vs-good-design-5-examples-we-can-learn-frombad-design-vs-good-design-5-examples-we-can-learn-from-130706)
    * user experience
        * how the interactions and more affect the user's perception and experience
        * goal of ux:
            * influence user's perception of brand/product
        * encompasses many, many things:
            - onboarding
            - branding
            - content
            - ui
            - and more!

        * [badux](http://badux.tumblr.com/)
    * common practices you've seen in the wild
        - hamburger menu
            - pro: hides menu
            - con: hides menu, also not 100% intuitive
            - [example](https://theoutline.com/)
        - # of items in navigation
            - keep it between 5-7
            - [example](https://wordpress.com/)
            - [example - too many options](https://www.usatoday.com/)
        - links should look like links, or at least different from standard text
            - otherwise, why would you click?
            - [example](http://www.goodui.org/)
        - email sign up pop ups
          - show on switching to tab
          - show as little pop up on bottom
        - logging in with social media
        - hotkeys!!!
            - often forgotten as part of UI
            - [example](https://workflowy.com/)
* local storage
