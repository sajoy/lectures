# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 13

The Bus Mall marketing team is getting frustrated. Every time they conduct a focus group, their data from last time is gone! They want to build a large collection of data - and see that compounded data reflected in the end graph.

### New Bus Mall Technical Goal

- Give your BusMall app some persistence by using local storage to store your voting data! The goal is to have all of your click data persist through a page refresh or through completely closing the browser. They want to see a cumulative tally of votes (so after three people have voting sessions, the chart would display all three of their results totaled).

** STRETCH GOALS **
- Display the current user's end tally as well as the cumulative total of votes. You could do this in a new chart or in the same one.
- Let the marketer's clear the data so they can start a new session at any time.
- Think about the UX for the marketers as well as the focus group participants. How could you improve your current website? Implement a couple of your ideas.
