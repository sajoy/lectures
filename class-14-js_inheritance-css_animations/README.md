## Notes

* CSS Animations
    * [MDN animatable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties)
    * Transitions ~ when an element changes state 
        * for example: on hover, or on click
        * use `transition` css property on the element you want to animate
    * Keyframes ~ not tied to a state change
        * use `animation` property on the element you want to animate AND create `keyframes` block outlining the animation
        * [another useful article](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/css-animation-for-beginners)
