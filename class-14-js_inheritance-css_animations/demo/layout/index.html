        TIP 
        to quickly disable a class for an element, add "x-" in front of the attribute name
        for example: <ul x-class="fixed-bottom-left">

        BORDER COLOR KEY
        blue solid: big container elements
        red dash: smaller container elements
        green dots: content elements
        (don't forget, borders do not encompass margins!)

        LAST THING
        try resizing your browser and see how that affects things
