Start with a meeting to assess how Tuesday went, and then plan Wednesday accordingly.

Your goal today: MVP. You want to have everything working, all of your core features in place, and bugs worked out. That will leave tomorrow for stretch goals and focusing on getting the look and feel dialed in to exactly what you want.

Keep in mind, that as we get closer to Friday, it's never too soon to start thinking about presentations, and one thing I'd encourage you to do is to test your project on the projector in the classroom. We'll share some specific strategies for presentation prep Thursday morning.
