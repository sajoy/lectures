1. Test your presentation:
    * As your teams now have MVP in place and are focusing more on layout, design, and stretch goals today, take a few minutes at some point to take a look at your app on the projector/screen setup. You'll be glad you did. It's often a moment of, "THAT'S not what we want it to look like!" We'll strive to have the instructor/TAs do this with each team on Thursday morning.

2. Plan your presentation... have a script:
    * Introduce yourselves (say your names! not everyone in the audience knows you) 
    * Introduce your project: tell us about the problem domain and your team's solution.
    * Demo your app! Walk us through functionality, however, this isn't the time to talk about what you *wish* you did.
    * Each person will share something technical they worked on: a challenge, a revelation, some code you're super proud of.

3. Rehearse your presentation:
    * Decide who's machine will present the app on the projector, test it, and then test a second computerâ€¦ just in case.
    * Your presentation should last a max of 15 minutes. 
    
4. Overall presentation script:
    * Intro
    * Demo
    * Individual technical reflections
    * Q&A
